                      <p>We introduce a doubly stochastic proximal gradient algorithm for optimizing a finite average of smooth convex subfunctions, whose gradients depend on numerically expensive expectations. Indeed, the effectiveness of SGD- like algorithms relies on the assumption that the computation of a subfunction&rsquo;s gradient is cheap compared to the computation of the total function&rsquo;s gradient. This is true in the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) setting, but can be false when each subfunction depends on a sequence of examples. Our main motivation is acceleration of the training-time of the penalized Cox partial-likelihood, which is the core model used in survival analysis for the study of clinical data, but our algorithm can be used in different settings as well. The proposed algorithm is doubly stochastic in the sense that gradient steps are done using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with variance reduction, where the inner expectations are approximated by a Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain (MCMC) algorithm. We derive conditions on the MCMC number of iterations under which convergence is guaranteed, and prove that a linear rate of convergence can be achieved under strong convexity. This exhibits a similar behaviour as recent SGD-like algorithms such as Prox-SVRG (which is the basis of our algorithm), SAGA and SDCA. We illustrate numerically the strong improvement given by our algorithm, in comparison with a state-of-the-art solver used for the Cox partial-likelihood </p>

                <p>In this paper we propose an overview of the recent academic literature devoted
	to the applications of Hawkes processes in finance. Hawkes processes
	constitute a particular class of multivariate point processes that 
	has become very popular in empirical high frequency finance this last decade.
	After a reminder of the main definitions and properties that characterize
	Hawkes processes, we review their main empirical applications to 
	address many different problems in high frequency finance. Because of their
	great flexibility and versatility, we show that they have been successfully
	involved in issues as diverse as estimating the volatility at the level of transaction data,
	estimating the market stability, accounting for systemic risk contagion, 
	devising optimal execution strategies or capturing the dynamics of the full order book.</p>

                <p>We consider the problem of unveiling the implicit network structure of user interactions in a social network, based only on high-frequency timestamps. Our inference is based on the minimization of the least-squares loss associated with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by L1 and trace norms. We provide a first theoretical analysis of the generalization error for this problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank inducing priors. This result involves a new data-driven concentration inequality for matrix martingales in continuous time with observable variance, which is a result of independent interest. A consequence of our analysis is the construction of sharply tuned L1 and trace-norm penalizations, that leads to a data-driven scaling of the variability of information available for each users. Numerical experiments illustrate the strong improvements achieved by the use of such data-driven penalizations.</p>

                <p>This paper gives new concentration inequalities for the spectral norm of matrix martingales in continuous time. Both cases of purely discountinuous and continuous martingales are considered. The analysis is based on a new supermartingale property of the trace exponential, based on tools from stochastic calculus. Matrix martingales in continuous time are probabilistic objects that naturally appear for statistical learning of time-dependent sys- tems. We focus here on the the microscopic study of (social) networks, based on self-exciting counting processes, such as the Hawkes process, together with a low-rank prior assumption of the self-exciting component. A consequence of these new concentration inequalities is a push forward of the theoretical analysis of such models.</p>

                <p>We present a modified version of the non parametric Hawkes kernel estimation procedure studied in [5] that is adapted to slowly decreasing kernels. We show on numerical simulations involving a reasonable number of events that this method allows us to estimate faithfully a power-law decreasing kernel over at least 6 decades. We then propose a 8-dimensional Hawkes model for all events associated with the first level of some asset order book. Applying our estimation procedure to this model, allows us to uncover the main properties of the coupled dynamics of trade, limit and cancel orders in relationship with the mid-price variations.</p>

                <p>In this work we investigate the generic properties of a stochastic linear model in the regime of high-dimensionality. We consider in particular the Vector AutoRegressive model (VAR) and the multivariate Hawkes process. We analyze both deterministic and random versions of these models, showing the existence of a stable and an unstable phase. We find that along the transition region separating the two regimes, the cor- relations of the process decay slowly, and we characterize the conditions under which these slow correlations are expected to become power-laws. We check our findings with numerical simulations showing remarkable agreement with our predictions. We finally argue that real systems with a strong degree of self-interaction are naturally characterized by this type of slow relaxation of the correlations.<br>

                <p>In this paper, we use a database of around 400,000 metaorders issued by investors and electronically traded on European markets in 2010 in order to study market impact at different scales. <br>
                At the intraday scale we confirm a square root temporary impact in the daily participation, and we shed light on a duration factor in 1/T &gamma; with &gamma; ? 0.25. Including this factor in the fits reinforces the square root shape of impact. We observe a power-law for the transient impact with an exponent between 0.5 (for long metaorders) and 0.8 (for shorter ones). Moreover we show that the market does not anticipate the size of the meta-orders. The intraday decay seems to exhibit two regimes (though hard to identify precisely): a &ldquo;slow&rdquo; regime right after the execution of the meta-order followed by a faster one. At the daily time scale, we show price moves after a metaorder can be split between realizations of expected returns that have triggered the investing decision and an idiosynchratic impact that slowly decays to zero. Moreover we propose a class of toy models based on Hawkes processes (the Hawkes Impact Models, HIM) to illustrate our reasoning. We show how the Impulsive-HIM model, despite its simplicity, embeds appealing features like transience and decay of impact. The latter is parametrized by a parameter C having a macroscopic interpretation: the ratio of contrarian reaction (i.e. impact decay) and of the "herding" reaction (i.e. impact amplification).<br>

          <p>We show that the jumps correlation matrix of a multivariate Hawkes process is related to the Hawkes kernel matrix through a system of Wiener-Hopf integral equations. A Wiener-Hopf argument allows one to prove that this system (in which the kernel matrix is the unknown) possesses a unique causal solution and consequently that the second-order properties fully characterize a Hawkes process. The numerical inversion of this system of integral equations allows us to propose a fast and efficient method, which main principles were initially sketched in [Bacry and Muzy, 2013], to perform a non-parametric estimation of the Hawkes kernel matrix. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of this non-parametric estimation procedure in the general framework of marked Hawkes processes. We describe precisely this procedure step by step. We discuss the estimation error and explain how the values for the main parameters should be chosen. Various numerical examples are given in order to illustrate the broad possibilities of this estimation procedure ranging from 1-dimensional (power-law or non positive kernels) up to 3-dimensional (circular dependence) processes. A comparison to other non-parametric estimation procedures is made. Applications to high frequency trading events in financial markets and to earthquakes occurrence dynamics are finally considered.<br>

    <p>We introduce a multivariate Hawkes process that accounts for the dynamics
      of market prices through the impact of market order arrivals at
      microstructural level. Our model is a point process mainly characterized
      by 4 kernels associated with respectively the trade arrival
      self-excitation, the price changes mean reversion the impact of trade
      arrivals on price variations and the feedback of price changes on trading
      activity. It allows one to account for both stylized facts of market
      prices microstructure<br>
      (including random time arrival of price moves, discrete price grid, high
      frequency mean reversion, correlation functions behavior at various time
      scales) and the stylized facts of market impact (mainly the
      concave-square-root-like/relaxation characteristic shape of the market
      impact of a meta-order). Moreover, it allows one to estimate the entire
      market impact profile from anonymous market data. We show that these
      kernels can be empirically estimated from the empirical conditional mean
      intensities. We provide numerical examples, application to real data and

      correlation (integral) scale in random cascade models. We propose a new
      model that possesses multifractal properties without involving any
      integral scale. This model relies on a non stationary log-normal process
      which proper- ties, over any finite time interval, are very close to
      continuous cascade models. These latter models are notably well known to
      reproduce faithfully the main stylized fact of financial time series but
      the integral scale where the cascade is initiated is hard to interpret.
      Moreover the reported empirical values of this large scale turn out to be
      closely correlated to the overall length of the sample. As illustrated by
      the example of Dow-Jones index, this feature is precisely predicted by our

    <p>We prove a law of large numbers and a functional central limit theorem

      process, when the observations are imposed by a discrete scheme with mesh
      \Delta over [0,T] up to some further time shift ?. The behaviour of this
      functional depends on the relative size of \Delta and ? with respect to T
      and enables to give a full account of the second-order structure. As an
      application, we develop our results in the context of financial
      statistics. We introduced in a micro- scopic stochastic model for the
      variations of a multivariate financial asset, based on Hawkes processes
      and that is confined to live on a tick grid. We derive and characterise

      Quantitative finance, Volume 13, Issue 1, January 2013, pages 65-77</h4>
    <p>We introduce a new stochastic model for the variation of asset prices at
      the tick-by-tick level in dimension 1 (for a single asset) and 2 (for a
      pair of assets). The construction is based on marked point processes and
      relies on linear self and mutually exciting stochastic intensities as
      introduced by Hawkes. We associate a counting process with the positive
      and negative jumps of an asset price. By coupling suitably the stochastic
      intensities of upward and downward changes of prices for several assets
      simultaneously, we can reproduce microstructure noise (i.e., strong
      microscopic mean reversion at the level of seconds to a few minutes) and
      the Epps effect ({\it i.e.} the decorrelation of the increments in
      microscopic scales) while preserving a standard Brownian diffusion
      behaviour on large scales.<br>
      More effectively, we obtain analytical closed-form formulae for the mean
      signature plot and the correlation of two price increments that enable to
      track across scales the effect of the mean-reversion up to the diffusive
      limit of the model. We show that the theoretical results are consistent
      with empirical fits on futures BUND 10Y and BOBL 5Y in several situations.</p>

      Proceedings of Econophys-Kolkata V (Kolkata, India, 2010).</h3>
    <p>By studying all the trades and best bids/asks of ultra high frequency
      snapshots recorded from the order books of a basket of 10 futures assets,
      we bring qualitative empirical evidence that the impact of a single trade<br>
      depends on the intertrade time lags. We find that when the trading rate
      becomes faster, the return variance per trade or the impact, as measured
      by the price variation in the direction of the trade, strongly increases.
      We provide evidence that these properties persist at coarser time scales.
      We also show that the spread value is an increasing function of the
      activity. This suggests that order books are more likely empty when the
      trading rate is high.</p>

    <p>Hawkes processes are used for modeling tick-by-tick variations of a
      single or of a pair of asset prices. For each asset, two counting
      processes (with stochastic intensities) are associated respectively with
      the positive and negative jumps of the price. We show that, by coupling
      these two intensities, one can reproduce high-frequency mean reversion
      structure that is characteristic of the microstructure noise. Moreover, in
      the case of two assets, by coupling the stochastic intensities
      corresponding to the positive (resp. negative) jumps of each asset, we are
      able to reproduce the Epps effect, i.e., the decorrelation of the
      increments at microscopic scales.<br>
      At large scale our model becomes diffusive and converge towards a standard
      Brownian motion. Analytical closed-form formulae for the mean signature
      plot, the diffusive correlation matrix and the cross-asset correlation
      function at any time-scale are given. Empirical results are shown on
      futures Euro-Bund and Euro-Bobl high frequency data.</p>

      Annals of Applied Probability, Volume 20, Number 5, 1729-1760 (2010).</h4>
    <p>Multifractal analysis of multiplicative random cascades is revisited
      within the framework of mixed asymptotics. In this new framework,
      statistics are estimated over a sample which size increases as the
      resolution scale (or the sampling period) becomes finer. This allows one
      to continuously interpolate between the situation where one studies a
      single cascade sample at arbitrary fine scales and where at fixed scale,
      the sample length (number of cascades realizations) becomes infinite. We
      show that scaling exponents of ”mixed” partitions functions i.e., the
      estimator of the cumulant generating function of the cascade generator
      distribution, depends on some “mixed asymptotic” exponent ? respectively
      above and beyond two critical value. We study the convergence properties
      of partition functions in mixed asymtotics regime and establish a central
      limit theorem. These results are shown to remain valid within a general
      wavelet analysis framework. Their interpretation in terms of Besov
      frontier are discussed. Moreover, within the mixed asymptotic framework,
      we establish a “box-counting” multifractal formalism that can be seen as a
      rigorous formulation of Mandelbrot’s negative dimension theory. Numerical
      illustrations of our purpose on specific examples are also <br>

    <h4>E.Bacry, A.Kozhemyak, J.F.Muzy <br>
      Quantitative finance, Volume 13, Issue 5, pp 795-818 (2013)</h4>
    <p>Log-normal continuous random cascades form a class of multifractal
      processes that has already been successfully used in various fields.
      Several statistical issues related to this model are studied. We first
      make a quick but extensive review of their main properties and show that
      most of these properties can be analytically studied. We then develop an
      approximation theory of these processes in the limit of small
      intermittency, i.e., when the degree of multifractality is small. This
      allows us to prove that the probability distributions associated with
      these processes possess some very simple aggregation properties accross
      time-scales. Such a control of the process properties at different
      time-scales, allows us to address the problem of parameter estimation. We
      show that one has to distinguish two different asymptotic regimes: the
      first one, referred to as the ”low frequency regime”, corresponds to
      taking a sample whose overall size increases whereas the second one,
      referred to as the ”high frequency regime”, corresponds to sampling the
      process at an increasing sampling rate. We show that, the first regime
      leads to convergent estimators whereas, in the high frequency regime, the
      situation is much more intricate: only the intermittency coefficient can
      be estimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in
      practical situations, one candetect the nature of the asymptotic regime
      (low frequency versus high frequency) and consequently decide whether the
      estimations of the other parameters are reliable or not. We finally
      illustrate how both our results on parameter estimation and on aggregation
      properties, allow one to successfully use these models for modelization
      and prediction of financial time series. </p>

    <h4>J.F.Muzy, E.Bacry, R.Baile, P.Poggi <br>
      Euro. Physics Letters 82, 60007-60011 (2008)</h4>
    <p>In this paper we revisit an idea originally proposed by Mandelbrot about
      the possibility to observe “negative dimensions” in random multifractals.
      For that purpose, we define a new way to study scaling where the
      observation scale ? and the total sample length L are respectively going
      to zero and to infinity. This “mixed” asymptotic regime is parametrized by
      an exponent ? that corresponds to Mandelbrot “supersampling exponent”. In
      order to study the scaling exponents in the mixed regime, we use a
      formalism introduced in the context of the physics of disordered systems
      relying upon traveling wave solutions of some non-linear iteration
      equation. Within our approach, we show that for random multiplicative
      cascade models, the parameter ? can be interpreted as a negative dimension
      and, as anticipated by Mandelbrot, allows one to uncover the “hidden”
      negative part of the singularity spectrum, corresponding to “latent”
      singularities. We illustrate our purpose on synthetic cascade models. When
      applied to turbulence data, this formalism allows us to distinguish two
      popular phenomenological models of dissipation intermittency: We show that
      the mixed scaling exponents agree with a log-normal model and not with
      log-Poisson statistics. </p>

    <p>We discuss a possible scenario explaining in what respect the observed
      fat tails of asset returns or volatility fluctuations can be related to
      volatility long-range correlations. Our approach is based on recently
      introduced multifractal models for asset returns that account for the
      volatility correlations through a multiplicative random cascade. Within
      the framework of these models, it can be shown that the sample size
      required for a correct estimation of the behavior of extreme return
      fluctuations is generally huge and outside the range of accessible size of
      data. Consequently, in many cases, the extreme tail probability appears as
      a power-law, with a rather small (underestimated) tail exponent. We point
      out that increasing the amount of data by using smaller and smaller
      (intraday) scales, does not contribute to reduce the bias and, as observed
      empirically, the tail exponent turns out to be rather stable across
      scales. <br>

    <p>In this paper we discuss the problem of the estimation of extreme event
      occurrence probability for data drawn from some multifractal process. We
      also study the heavy (power-law) tail behavior of probability density
      function associated with such data. We show that because of strong
      correlations, standard extreme value approach is not valid and classical
      tail exponent estimators should be interpreted cautiously. Extreme
      statistics associated with multifractal random processes turn out to be
      characterized by non self-averaging properties. Our considerations rely
      upon some analogy between random multiplicative cascades and the physics
      of disordered systems and also on recent mathematical results about the
      so-called multifractal formalism. Applied to financial time series, our
      findings allow us to propose an unified framemork that accounts for the

    Various wavelet based estimators of the scaling exponent of self-similar
    time-series are studied extensively. These estimators mainly include the
    (bi)orthogonal wavelet estimators and the Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima
    (WTMM) estimator. This study focuses both on short and long time-series. In
    the framework of fractional ARIMA processes, we advocate the use of the
    "approximately" adapted wavelet estimator. For, in these "ideal" processes,
    the scaling behavior actually extends down to the smallest scale, i.e., the
    sampling period of the time series. But in practical situations, there
    generally exists a cut-off scale below which the scaling behavior no longer
    holds. We test the robustness of the set of wavelet based estimators with
    respect to that cut-off scale as well as to the specific density of the
    underlying law of the process. In all situations the WTMM estimator is shown
    to be the best or among the best estimators in terms of the mean square
    error. We also compare the wavelet estimators with the Detrended Fluctuation
    Analysis (DFA) estimator which was recently proved to be among the best non
    wavelet based non parametric estimators. The WTMM estimator turns out to be
    a very competitive estimator which can be further generalized to
